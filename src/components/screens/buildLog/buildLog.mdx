## Week of January 8, 2024

### Planning

- Questions for first meeting:
  - Create a separate page for build log?
  - Power source during capstone symposium?
- Tasks for everyone
  - Adrian: frontend + mobile (ios OR android)
  - Adam: backend + desktop (windows)
  - Cameron: embedded (NFC)
  - Jonah: build door (machining, 3D printing, power management)
  - Allen: assembly + testing of handle and integrated systems (electrical + mechanical)
- Machine handle (by first week of february)
- 3D printing enclosure, a lot of the internal components
  - SLA or SLS
