## Week of January 8, 2024

### Planning

- Questions for first meeting:
  - Create a separate page for build log?
  - Power source during capstone symposium?
- Tasks for everyone
  - Adrian: frontend + mobile (ios OR android)
  - Adam: backend + desktop (windows)
  - Cameron: embedded (NFC)
  - Jonah: build door (machining, 3D printing, power management)
  - Allen: assembly + testing of handle and integrated systems (electrical + mechanical)
- Machine handle (by first week of february)
- 3D printing enclosure, a lot of the internal components
  - SLA or SLS

## Week of January 15, 2024

### Hardware

- Finalized CAD and BOM for the lock ([@AllenZhang2989](https://github.com/AllenZhang2989))
- Started manufacturing and procurement of parts ([@AllenZhang2989](https://github.com/AllenZhang2989))
- Test door designed and constructed ([@jonahbelman](https://github.com/jonahbelman))
  - Next steps are to route out cavities for lock faceplate and strike/power in

<LocalVid id="door_prototype.mov" />

- Strike designed to take 12 V and output desired power to charge onboard batteries ([@jonahbelman](https://github.com/jonahbelman))
- Latch BOM finalized ([@jonahbelman](https://github.com/jonahbelman))

### Software

- Add build log ([@AdrianJendo](https://github.com/AdrianJendo) in [#4](https://github.com/lynx-locks/lynx-locks.github.io/pull/4))
- Initial frontend app setup ([@AdrianJendo](https://github.com/AdrianJendo) in [#2](https://github.com/lynx-locks/lynx-web/pull/2))

### Embedded

- Experimented with I2C protocol for PN532.
- Discovered the PN532 breakout board is unresponsive with both primary communication protocols.

## Week of January 22, 2024

### Hardware

### Embedded

- Went to MME clinic with Allen to analyze I2C signals. Discovered that the ESP32 is sending signals but PN532 is unresponsive.
- Tested I2C protocol with a different sensor to confirm that microcontroller is working properly and PN532 is broken.

## Week of January 29, 2024

### Hardware
